          These are some game prototypes on which I worked but didn't get to
          release. Working on these projects helped me learn the Unity engine
          and provided me with strong foundations for my future endeavors.

              This is a small game, but it's the first one I've properly
              finished. After experimenting with the Unity Engine for some time,
              I made the decision to embark on and complete a small project,
              complete with a proper title screen, levels, and gameplay loop.
              <br />
              <br />
              At the time I had no skill at drawing and making assets, so the
              visuals are only made of simple shapes.

              The gameplay is simple: reach the goal marked by a blue rectangle.
              To move around, you hold the mouse button, causing the ball to
              rotate. A triangle on the ball indicates the direction. When the
              player releases the mouse button, the ball jumps in the direction
              it's pointing. For finer control over rotation, the player can use
              both mouse buttons. The right-click rotates the ball clockwise,
              while the left button rotates it counter-clockwise. Holding both
              buttons keeps the rotation still, allowing the player to 'confirm'
              their shot.
            </p>

          <div class="lefty">
            <p>
              The game ended up featuring a total of 10 levels. The final level
              resembled a 'Boss fight,' where the player had to reach three
              different goal markers while avoiding the boss' attacks.
              <br />
              <br />
              This game could have been expanded by adding more levels, but I
              kept the scope small and considered it finished. I shared the game
              with some friends, and we had a lot of fun playing it. Little did
              I know at the time, this game would set me on the path to becoming
              a hobbyist game developer.

            <p>
              Some time after finishing 'Ball that jumps', I had an idea for an
              easy-to-make sequel. Heavily inspired by 'Getting Over It with
              Bennett Foddy', I began developing a game about climbing a
              mountain using the movement mechanics from my previous game.
              <br />
              <br />
              A part of the game I wanted to replicate is how punishing it is to
              miscalculate a movement and falling down to the beginning.

              In 'Getting over it' the narrator points out how the level is
              built from premade assets he just downloaded from the internet,
              but when put togheter for the game, they formed the world, the
              mountain for the player to climb.
              <br />
              <br />
              While my game didn't aim to deliver such profound messages as
              Bennett Foddy's, it did inspire me to utilize my own accumulated
              'trash' assets. So I fine tuned the phyiscs and controls to make
              them feel juicier and started building a level made up with
              various assets and images I had made for other projects.

              I added elements like moving platforms, fake platforms, effectors
              and a system to play audio at different points. The mountain
              consisted of various characters, obstacles, and art I had drawn
              myself.
              <br /><br />
              I built a big portion of the game, but never quite finished the
              mountain, funnily enough, I didn't have enough trash to make it
              very long. I may return to it later with way more trash.

              In 2023, a friend who's also passionate about game development,
              introduced me to a game studio he worked for, T3AMPO, who were
              looking for a programmer to build a prototype of a game they wanted
              to make.
              <br />
              <br />
              They had already started development but my friend, who was the
              previous developer, was needed to work on another project of
              theirs, so they hired me for approximately two months to assist
              with the ongoing development.

              The game is an 'Adventure platformer that combines intuitive
              puzzle solving with the power of imagination'. The player has to
              draw their weapon on a canvas, and different stats are given to it
              depending on the amount of ink used and number of strokes.
              <br />
              <br />
              On my time working with them I programmed the basis for a combat
              system, enemy behaviour and the ability to bring drawn objects
              into the world to solve puzzles.

              Sadly, I had to leave the development team because I was very busy
              with university. The studio hired some more programmers and I got
              to meet them and answer questions about the code. Overall the
              experience was very enriching.
              <br />
              <br />
              The studio showcased Imagink at GameJam+ Brazil 2023 and secured
              funding from a sponsor after winning various prizes.

              They continued development and eventually realeased the game. You
