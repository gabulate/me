          These are a few small projects that didn't quite make it to the
          prototype stage. Often, I would start working on an idea, develop it
          to some extent, and then abandon it either because it wasn't
          enjoyable, didn't align with my vision, or because I struggled to
          progress further with it. I've selected three of these projects to
          showcase here, ones that I found interesting enough to share.

              I attempted to create a traditional three lanes endless runner
              game, where players would need to attack oncoming enemies. I
              started by implementing a system for generating the infinite map
              with obstacles randomly distributed across the lanes. However, the
              side-view perspective, intended to provide clarity on approaching
              enemies, ironically made it challenging to tell which lane the
              obstacles were in and my inexperience in programming at the time
              led me to problems with generating the map.

              I started this little project after watching a video about
              pathfinding in Unity, feeling inspired to give it a shot. I
              quickly put together a scene with obstacles, a player controller,
              and a pathfinding agent. In the game, you control the larger bug,
              while the smaller one follows you around using the pathfinding
              algorithm.

              You can also click anywhere on the screen to send the little bug
              to that spot. It will autonomously find a path and navigate to the
              destination without getting stuck on obstacles. Clicking again
              makes the small bug return to following you. I thought this
              mechanic could be used to make an interesting puzzle game, but I
              didn't pursue it further. Perhaps I'll revisit the idea in the
              future. It was for this project that I originally drew the bug's
              sprite, at the time I didn't put much thought into it but ended up
              really liking it and started putting it everywhere I can.

              This project was born out of inspiration by a video tutorial on
              creating peer-to-peer multiplayer lobbies using Steam's API. It
              sets up a lobby linked to your Steam user, allowing you to invite
              friends to join. The vision I had for this game was to develop a
              2D shooter, similar to a mobile game my friends and I used to play
              called 'Mini Militia'. I wanted the characters to look stylish and
              have nice animations for moving around and I like what I was able
              to achieve in that aspect.

              Unfortunately, making a multiplayer game proved to be much more
              difficult and it didn't help that at the time I was very
              inexperienced in programming and game development, testing
              multiplayer features was complicated while working on my single
              laptop. It also introduced many complications about server and
              client coordination, issues with spawning objects, playing
              animations, movement and aim of the player characters, and more.
              Despite all that, I want to try it again in the future, with a
              better understanding of networking.
