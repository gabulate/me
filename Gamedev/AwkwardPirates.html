          Awkward Pirates was developed as an entry for GameJam+ 2024 in under 3
          days. From the theme "Throwback Thrill" we created a game in the
          aesthetic medium "Pixel Art". It is about 4 pirates and Captain
          Pascual, whose goal is to reach mainland without their ship sinking.
          Participating on GameJam+ was an amazing experience and such a great
          time!

              After the themes for the game jam were revealed we got to thinking
              fast about potential ideas and concepts for our game. From before
              hand we had agreed on themes and games we did and did not want to
              make. <br />
              We quickly agreed on a game with a somewhat grim atmosphere and we
              got inspired to make the scenario a boat where you would face
              threats from fantastical sea creatures. We went back and forth
              with different ideas until we thought of making a resource manager
              kind of game where you would have to order your tripulation around
              to do tasks that helped the ship move and other tasks to fix the
              boat to avoid it sinking.

              Aylan and I quickly got to building the systems we would need for
              the gameplay loop while Lucas started drawing the characters and
              Elena sketched the background for the play area. <br />
              The main gameplay consists of clicking on the crew members to
              assign them to different tasks like rowing, fixing the sail and
              fixing water leaks.

              Eventually you will face a mermaid who will hipnotize your
              tripulation and kill them if you don't act fast enough, leaving
              you impaired and sure to sink if you lose everyone. <br />
              We had planned for more encounters and tasks but unfortunately,
              under the time limit, we had to cut content, which is totally
              normal on game jams.

          You will get a game over screen if your boat sinks or a game won
          screen if you manage to beat the game. Despite being mainly a
          programmer, I took the time to make these illustrations and I think
          they gave the game some charm.

          This was only the first phase of GameJam+. After this we had to make a
          video pitch and continue working towards a complete game.
          <br />
          Our team stuck togheter for the first few months, but unfortunately,
          due to our schedules and responsibilities we decided to stop working
          on the game and drop out of the second phase. We had a lot of fun and
          who knows, we might work togheter again in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Participating on this game jam was an amazing experience, not only
          because of what we managed to make, but also interacting with the
          community, talking with the other teams' developers and artists, and
          taking a look at their work was one of the best parts of the event.
          There were so many talented and fun people working on games.
          <br />
          I have to give a shoutout to Rodolfo Mora-Zamora for organizing the
          event and being the head of the CiDeV community. He is one of the
          great people pushing for the growth of game development in Costa Rica.
        </p>
