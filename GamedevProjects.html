          Video game development is one of my biggest passions and one of the
          main reasons I became a software engineer. <br />
          It is hard. It involves so many different disciplines and skills.
          Programming, game design, art, animation, 3d modeling, sound design,
          music composing and more have to all come togheter to make a
          comprehensive work. However, I really like the challenge it poses.
          <br />
          Learning a little about each aspect of making a game has been very
          interesting and fulfilling. I may not be an expert on any of these
          areas alone, but I like being a jack of all trades kind of developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I don't expect to make a penny by making games nor I expect them to be
          played by many. I do game development as a hobby because I genuinly
          enjoy creating and learning, but still, I would really appreciate it
          if you checked out my games!
          <br />
          To this date, the only game I've released is Structured Defenders,
          which you can get for free from itch.io.
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          I'm currently working on another game, it may take a long time before
          I have anything to show. Once I manage to release it I will write
          about it here, but for now, you can read about the development of
          Structured Defenders and some of my other prototypes.
