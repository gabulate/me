              This game was heavily influenced by Vampire Survivors, by Poncle.
              A game where you slay hordes of enemies with weapons that
              passively attack on their own while you just walk around
              collecting XP to get more weapons to slay more enemies. <br />
              I thought about combining this idea with Tower Defense games,
              where you place different units that also attack on their own. In
              typical Tower Defense games, the player has total vision of the
              playable area and have to make sure the enemies don't reach a
              certain point or object. But for this game, the enemies go after
              the player who controls and moves around as a physical character
              so they have to play around their units and aren't as free to move
              around the map.

              I liked this idea because it was very simple and manageable as a
              single developer. So I started working on it around November 2023.
              I developed systems for placing and upgrading structures and
              passive items that effect the statistics of the placed structures.
              Each structure and item exists as a Scriptable Object which can be
              easily modified to set different statistics at different levels.
              <br />

        <div class="flexy">
          <div class="lefty">
            <p>
              One of the other major systems I had to make was the player
              leveling up and getting a random list of available items to choose
              from. This wasn't very complicated but I did have to consider
              scenarios like not offering passive items that have already been
              maxed out, if all the passive item slots are filled, only show
              items that the player already has, not offer structures if the
              player has 4 or more structures in their inventory, only offer
              items the player has unlocked and if no items are eligible, the
              player just gets some extra coins.

              Another major system was the spawning of enemies, in which my game
              differs a little from Vampire Survivors. For starters, the enemies
              won't de-spawn (Although there is a limit to the maximum amount of
              enemies), no matter how far the player gets from them. The order
              of the enemies is random, but it is divided in waves and will
              always spawn the same amount of enemies, and the velocity of the
              spawner will speed up or slow down depending on how the player is
              doing, so you could last the same amount of time on two matches
              but have very different scores.

              The part that definitely took the most time was making all the
              assets. Every sprite you see in the game was drawn by myself. I
              went for pixel art to make it simpler and easier to maintain a
              coherent style. I had previous experience with digital art, but I
              had never tried pixel art, at least for a project on this scale.
              The pixel art style also let me get away with making most
              animations be only 3 or 4 frames. <br />
              Still, even with these creative restrictions, drawing every sprite
              was the most time consuming part of this project. I'm no
              professional artist, but I think the overall aesthetic turned out
              okay.

              For the enemies included in the game (aside from the little bug
              creatures) I decided to draw inspiration from costa rican and
              latin-american culture. "Duendes", "La Tulevieja", "El Sisimiqui",
              "El Padre sin cabeza", "La Llorona" and my personal favorite; "La
              Segua" do as the enemies that the player has to fight off. <br />

              There's also different characters that the player can unlock and
              play as, with the only differences between them being their
              appearance and their starting item. <br />
              <br />
              This game could be endlessly expanded by adding more structures,
              more characters, more enemies, more levels, more content...

              But after about 6 months of development, I really wanted to move
              on to other projects, so I decided to wrap up development of new
              content and polish the game for release. This of course meant
              cutting ideas and other things I wanted to include, but if I felt
              that I would never finish the game if I didn't. I also didn't want
              to be stuck in the same project and end up hating or resenting it,
              after all, since the beginning I set myself to make something
              simple, and this is also just my first game!<br />

              I started development in November 2023 and officially finished it
              in July 2024 by working on it on my free time. <br />
              Including seemingly small things like support for multiple
              languages, a settings menu, unlockables and a save system added a
              bit to the development time. In the end, I learned a lot and even
              with all the difficulties. I'm proud of this silly little game I
